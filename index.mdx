## Core New Features

Here's everything new thats going to catch your eye.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cold Calling (with phone numbers)" iconType="regular">
    Mission Control previously presented a list of email addresses to paste into **ZoomInfo (no longer in use) **which then returned a list of cell/phone matches to dial.

    Now Mission Control does all of this directly in the CRM. As a final attempt (after sending your followup), you can select Send LinkedIn Messages (LINK) or Make Cold Calls.

    ![image.png](/images/image.png)

    When clicking Make Cold Calls, a countdown timer appears. For some reason, it takes [**Apollo.io**](http://Apollo.io)** **some time to return the phone numbers and assign them to the contact. 

    <Tip>
      Although the phone numbers are avaliable instantly via the **Apollo **plugin, the API takes some time to return bulk numbers. These are usually returned within 5 minutes (hence the countdown timer) but sometimes it can take longer for some to filter through.
    </Tip>
    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at21 32 47 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.32.47.png)

    Once the phone numbers are returned, you'll see a button prompting you to continue. Clicking this opens the cold calling window which generates a cold call script for you to read on each of the attempted calls.

    <Note>
      The cold calling script is generated using OpenAI. We send over the original e-shot and it returns a cold calling script unique to each person.

    Here you see how many numbers have been returned. You also have counters for No Answer, Not Interested and Interested. 

    Here you have several options:

    - **Resend Email: **resends the original email to the client, instantly.
    - **Didn't Answer: **marks and skips to the next contact. Logs on profile.
    - **Not Interested: **marks and skips to the next contact. Logs on profile.
    - **Interested: **opens an opportunity (LINK) and allows you to continue in a new tab. Here you can add vacancy notes / general notes about the call.

    You will also see **View Full Profile. **This opens the profile in a new tab so you do not lose your progress on the cold calling wizard.

    <Warning>
      We know that sometimes [**Apollo.io**](http://Apollo.io)** **will return the incorrect phone numbers. Sometimes it also returns more than once. Unfortuantely this is outside of our control as this is an external data source. Just skip and move on.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Preview changes" icon="rectangle-terminal">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look 

    as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally.

    1. Install the
       [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
       documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
       `docs.json` is): `mintlify dev`

    <Note>
      If youâ€™re currently using the legacy `mint.json` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      `npm i -g mintlify@latest`
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      `mintlify upgrade`
      You should now be using the new `docs.json` configuration file. Feel free to delete the `mint.json` file from your repository.
