## Core New Features

Here's everything new thats going to catch your eye.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cold Calling (with phone numbers)" iconType="regular">
    Mission Control previously presented a list of email addresses to paste into \*\*ZoomInfo (no longer in use) \*\*which then returned a list of cell/phone matches to dial.

    Now Mission Control does all of this directly in the CRM. As a final attempt (after sending your followup), you can select Send LinkedIn Messages (LINK) or Make Cold Calls.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at21 32 23 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.32.23.png)

    When clicking Make Cold Calls, a countdown timer appears. For some reason, it takes [**Apollo.io**](http://Apollo.io)\*\* \*\*some time to return the phone numbers and assign them to the contact.

    <Tip>
      Although the phone numbers are avaliable instantly via the \*\*Apollo \*\*plugin, the API takes some time to return bulk numbers. These are usually returned within 5 minutes (hence the countdown timer) but sometimes it can take longer for some to filter through.
    </Tip>
    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at21 32 47 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.32.47.png)

    Once the phone numbers are returned, you'll see a button prompting you to continue. Clicking this opens the cold calling window which generates a cold call script for you to read on each of the attempted calls.

    <Note>
      The cold calling script is generated using OpenAI. We send over the original e-shot and it returns a cold calling script unique to each person.
    </Note>
    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at21 37 17 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.37.17.png)

    Here you see how many numbers have been returned. You also have counters for No Answer, Not Interested and Interested.

    Here you have several options:

    - \*\*Resend Email: \*\*resends the original email to the client, instantly.
    - \*\*Didn't Answer: \*\*marks and skips to the next contact. Logs on profile.
    - \*\*Not Interested: \*\*marks and skips to the next contact. Logs on profile.
    - \*\*Interested: \*\*opens an opportunity (LINK) and allows you to continue in a new tab. Here you can add vacancy notes / general notes about the call.

    You will also see \*\*View Full Profile. \*\*This opens the profile in a new tab so you do not lose your progress on the cold calling wizard.

    <Warning>
      We know that sometimes [**Apollo.io**](http://Apollo.io)\*\* \*\*will return the incorrect phone numbers. Sometimes it also returns more than once. Unfortuantely this is outside of our control as this is an external data source. Just skip and move on.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Format CVs ">
    <Warning>
      It's really important we don't send CVs with contact information on them. These get caught up in all kinds of email filters and cause a nuisance. If the CV formatter leaves contact

      information on, please manually edit by converting the download to a word document (right click, Open with Word).
    </Warning>
    The CV formatter is pretty bang on. Sometimes it does miss information. It's impossible to get every variation of CV correct.

    <Warning>
      Formatting a CV does not automatically log it in your CV tracker. You should do this manually after sending each CV as data on CV sends is shared with Illumini (our backdoor partner).
    </Warning>
    To get started, go to the main menu and select \*\*New CV Format. \*\*The candidate must already be in the CRM to do format the CV. At this stage, it doesn't matter if the CV is uploaded or not.

    <img
      src="/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.49.56.png"
      alt="Screenshot2025 05 27at21 49 56 Pn"
      title="Screenshot2025 05 27at21 49 56 Pn"
      style={{ width:"100%" }}
    />

    Select the contact from the search results and you should be presented with a list of CVs on file (sometimes shown as external files). If no CVs return, you have the option to upload one. If the wrong CV returns, you should navigate to the candidates profile and upload a new file to continue.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at21 51 11 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.51.11.png)

    Once selecting the CV, you will be prompted to enter some information about the candidate. This varies from company to company.

    <Tip>
      You should ask your manager or the beta tester within your business which information appears on your CV format cover sheets.
    </Tip>
    <Warning>
      CV cover sheets cannot be customised to individuals. These are generic for the whole organisation. The only person who can request changes to a cover sheet are Directors and this will usually be processed within a week.
    </Warning>
    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at21 53 20 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.53.20.png)

    You should enter the relevant information and click '\*\*Generate CV format'. \*\*Once the generation has started, the process shouldnt take more than a few seconds.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at21 54 05 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.54.05.png)

    The orb window will appear with a progression dialog. Once the CV is created, you will be prompted with a new window.

    <Warning>
      Sometimes CVs can take longer to process. It depends on the document size and current traffic on the service. Even if the CV doesnt complete within the dialog, it will automatically be attached to the candidates profile when it is.
    </Warning>
    Once completed, you will be alerted and you can open the CV or process another.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at21 55 23 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at21.55.23.png)

    <Warning>
      Errors on CVs should be reported via the Feedback app.
    </Warning>
    This CV will now be avaliable for download and attached to the candidates profile within the CRM. You should see a copy of the original and the processed document.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI drafted e-shots">
    When creating a list specific to a candidate (by linking the candidate), you will now be prompted to upload the CV (if the CV isnt already uploaded). There's several reasons for this:

    - Enhances data in the CRM
    - Saves time later when coming to format the CV
    - Allows the Assistive AI to attempt to write an e-shot for you
    - Allows your manager to easily review the resume when approving the e-shot.

    The CRM will then draft an e-shot for you. The model used to do this has been trained with e-shot data, but is still learning. Once the e-shot has been drafted, the system will navigate to the Assistant tab within the list.

    **The assistant tab contains the following:**

    - The drafted e-shot (assistive AI written)
    - Target companies (still working on this, not 100% in some markets)
    - Target job titles

    This should help you get started with your list. You can edit the draft e-shot content and adjust it to your liking.

    <Warning>
      Remember - this is \*\*Assistive AI \*\*and should always be checked. Any feedback can be given via the Feedback app.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dark Mode">
    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at22 02 14 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at22.02.14.png)

    Dark mode has been integrated throughout the CRM. This can be turned on at account creation or by clicking the moon icon in the top right. Dark Mode is stored against the user account so should follow you between devices.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at22 02 19 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at22.02.19.png)

    > Toggle Dark Mode by clicking the moon icon on the top right of all pages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Live Inbox">
    Mission Control can now read all emails from your inbox.

    Every 5 minutes, an external server scans your mailbox for changes, uploading the emails into Mission Control. This service also processes the automatic marking of responses within the CRM.

    Mission Control will not show internal emails and will skip the following:

    - Junk Emails
    - Emails from LinkedIn
    - Emails in Deleted Items
    - Internal Emails

    <Tip>
      Sometimes it can take a little longer for emails to load. The server is processing thousands of changes acorss hundreds of inboxes so make take time to respond.
    </Tip>
    **You can see emails in the following areas:**

    - Within contact/candidate profiles
    - Within opportunities
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Smarter AI employees">
    AI employees can now access the internet and have become more intelligent (and a lot less repetitive).

    You can now access AI employees by clicking the ChatGPT icon in the top left. This will open within the current window.

    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at22 09 10 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at22.09.10.png)

    <Warning>
      Conversations with AI employees are not saved and will delete when the page is reloaded. Saving and storing conversations significantly increases costs and slows down the service.
    </Warning>
    ![Screenshot2025 05 27at22 09 17 Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-05-27at22.09.17.png)
